# Website Project Plan

## Project Overview
Building a simple, single-page website using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript with modern CSS best practices.

## Technical Constraints
- **HTML**: Semantic markup, accessibility considerations
- **CSS**: Modern best practices (no frameworks)
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
  - CSS Custom Properties (variables)
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - No external CSS frameworks
- **JavaScript**: Plain vanilla JS only
  - ES6+ features where appropriate
  - No external libraries or frameworks
- **Architecture**: Single HTML page with stacked content blocks

## Project Goals
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Modern, responsive CSS implementation
- Progressive enhancement with JavaScript
- Accessible and performant design
- Modular block-based content structure

## Content Structure Approach
The website will be built as large content blocks that stack vertically on a single page. Each block will be self-contained and we'll build them incrementally.

## Project Requirements - GENUX Conference

### Confirmed Details
- **Purpose**: Conference website for GENUX (October 2025)
- **Structure**: 6 content blocks, no navigation
- **Animation**: Scrolling text animations
- **Design**: Will be provided via designs (style to be dictated later)
- **Content**: Blocks will be defined incrementally as we build

### Technical Implementation Plan
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with 6 main content blocks
- **CSS**: Foundation with custom properties, ready for design integration
- **JavaScript**: Scrolling text animation system
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels for animations and content

## Development Roadmap
1. ‚úÖ Create project plan and gather requirements
2. ‚úÖ Update plan with GENUX conference details
3. ‚úÖ Create HTML structure with 6 content blocks
4. ‚úÖ Set up CSS foundation (variables, reset, base styles)
5. ‚úÖ Implement scrolling text animation system
6. üîß Build out each block incrementally based on designs
7. ‚ú® Refine animations and interactions
8. üß™ Test across devices and browsers

## Design & Development Workflow

### Reference Materials Location
- **Design Files**: `reference/` folder
  - PNG files: Visual design mockups
  - PDF files: Design specifications with measurements, colors, typography details
- **Image Assets**: `assets/images/` folder
  - Asset names match specifications in PDF
  - Use exact filenames as referenced in specs

### Design Implementation Process
1. **Reference Both Files**: Always use PNG for visual reference AND PDF for precise specs
2. **Typography**: 
   - Use exact font names from specs
   - Assume fonts are locally available (installation handled separately)
   - Pay close attention to font weights, sizes, and line heights
3. **Assets**: 
   - Images located in `assets/images/`
   - Filenames match those specified in PDF specs
   - Optimize for web delivery
4. **Measurements**: Follow PDF specifications exactly for spacing, sizing, positioning
5. **Colors**: Extract exact color values from PDF specs

### Building Guidelines
- **Visual Fidelity**: Match PNG designs pixel-perfect where possible
- **Responsive Behavior**: Adapt designs appropriately for different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimize images and animations for web performance
- **Accessibility**: Maintain semantic HTML and proper contrast ratios

## Block Structure (To be defined from designs)
1. Block 1: [Awaiting design specs]
2. Block 2: [Awaiting design specs]
3. Block 3: [Awaiting design specs]
4. Block 4: [Awaiting design specs]
5. Block 5: [Awaiting design specs]
6. Block 6: [Awaiting design specs]

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Foundation Complete
- HTML structure with 6 semantic blocks
- CSS foundation with modern best practices
- JavaScript scrolling animation system
- Basic responsive framework ready

### üìÅ Available Assets
- **Reference Files**: `Hero.png`, `Hero.specs.pdf`, `Hero.specs.png`
- **Image Assets**: Brand logos (AIGA Boston, GENUX, TELUS Digital), Hero image
- **Ready for**: Design implementation of Block 1 (Hero section)

### üéØ Next Steps
1. Implement Hero block using reference files
2. Process remaining block designs as they become available
3. Integrate all image assets according to specs
4. Refine animations and interactions

### üí° Development Notes
- Font files will be handled separately - use font names from specs for now
- Image optimization will be applied during implementation
- Scrolling text animations ready for integration
- Responsive breakpoints established in CSS foundation
